# Helmet compliance
Using Machine learning we are trying to find the individuals who are not wearing helmet while driving and trying to retrieve their vechicle registration number from their vechicle number plate.  By using the vechicle registration number we can get that vechicle owner details from parivahan api and futher course of action on the defaulters will be decided by the Government or RTO office.

# Colab link
We have a copy of the code in Colab, for quick testing.
You can run the code in colab, you need to have gmail id, and your gdrive should have the datasets referred in the code.
